# Automated Negotiation Agent

This repository contains the code and [report](https://github.com/markvasin/negotiation_agent/blob/master/Negotiation_Agent_Report.pdf) for our automated negotiation agent. This is developed as part of the class competition in Intelligent Agent (COMP6203) module at the University of Southampton. 

## Project Description
In this work, we designed and developed a negotiation agent using [GENIUS](http://ii.tudelft.nl/genius/), a platform for developing automated multi-issues negotiation agents. The negotiation strategy of our agent is created using the combination of many state-of-the-art approaches from the literature including opponent modelling using frequency heuristic and Gaussian process regression, user model estimation using linear programming, and concession strategy that is adaptive based on opponentâ€™s behavior.
